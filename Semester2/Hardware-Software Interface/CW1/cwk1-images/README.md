# Sample images for F28HS coursework 1

There is a subdirectory here for each of the formats in the coursework
spec. Your program should be able to process all of the files in your
format.

The images in this collection were converted using the hsconvert tool
provided in the template project. Files with `.rand.` in their name were converted with the `-r` option, so they are useful for testing that your program handles some of the variations in the format correctly (e.g. different types of whitespace).

All images were created by the teaching team and can be considered to be
in the public domain, except for:
